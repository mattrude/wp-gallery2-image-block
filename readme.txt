Widget to display your Gallery 2 Image Block on your Wordpress sidebar

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to put one of the meny Gallery2 Image Blocks on your Wordpres site.  You are required to have a running Gallery2 install to use this plugin.  
  
This is a complete rewrite of \[Chris Schierer (aka Lentil)\](http://www.theschierers.net/blog) Gallery2 Image Block Plugin 0.1.4.  This rewrite uses the new Wordpress 2.8 Widget API, so is only compatable with wordpres 2.8+.  
  
Options described in the \[Gallery 2 Image Block\](http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery2:Modules:imageblock) documentation are included.  
  
User configuration of Image Block options is available through the Widget configuration panel.  Blank (empty) options use the Gallery2 defaults.  
  
\*Note:\* The widget is written using \[lib\_curl()\](http://www.php.net/curl) to avoid url\_fopen issues.
	
== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.
