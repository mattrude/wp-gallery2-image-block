# Gallery2 Image Block

This plugin will allow you to put one of the meny [Gallery2][1] Image Blocks on your [WordPress][2] site. You are required to have a running Gallery2 install to use this plugin.

This is a complete rewrite of [Chris Schierer (aka Lentil)][3], [Gallery2 Image Block Plugin 0.1.4][4]. This rewrite uses the new WordPress 2.8 Widget API, so is only compatable with wordpress 2.8+.

All options described in the [Gallery 2 Image Block documentation][5] are included. User configuration of Image Block options are available in the Widget configuration panel. Blank (empty) options use the Gallery2 defaults.

As of version 0.5, wp-gallery2-image-block has full localization support, and ships with 5 languages besides English. Please contact me if you would like to translate it into more langages, I would love for as meny peaple as posible to be able to use this plugin.
