# Gallery2 Image Block

<div class="description">
This plugin will allow you to put one of the meny [Gallery2][] Image
Blocks on your [WordPress][] site. You are required to have a running
Gallery2 install to use this plugin.

This is a complete rewrite of [Chris Schierer (aka Lentil)][], [Gallery2
Image Block Plugin 0.1.4][]. This rewrite uses the new WordPress 2.8
Widget API, so is only compatable with wordpress 2.8+.

All options described in the [Gallery 2 Image Block documentation][] are
included. User configuration of Image Block options are available in the
Widget configuration panel. Blank (empty) options use the Gallery2
defaults.

As of version 0.5, wp-gallery2-image-block has full localization
support, and ships with 5 languages besides English. Please contact me
if you would like to translate it into more langages, I would love for
as meny peaple as posible to be able to use this plugin.

Fully Translated into:

-   Dutch (0.5.1)
-   French
-   English
-   German
-   Italian (0.6.1)
-   Polish (0.6.1)
-   Portuguese (0.5.1)
-   Spanish

**Note:** This widget was written using wp\_http to increase
compatibility with more sites (version 0.6).
